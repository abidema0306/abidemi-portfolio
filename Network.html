                                This unit was about risks definitions, standards and approaches. I was able to learn about various definitions of risk relating to the concept of technology and not. 
                                Risk management is not entirely a new concept to me from the area of project management due to the fact I had worked with risk registers. However this unit merged the entire risk process from Context Establishment, Risk Identification, Risk Analysis, Risk Evaluation and Risk Treatment in a way that is easily understood and totally relatable to my previous experience. 
                                    <br> <br>
                            Learning about the different risk assessment methodologies - Quantitative and Qualitative risk assessment put a lot of things in perspective and especially how important it is to conduct a proper in-depth risk assessment  which sadly is missing in a lot of projects where I have been involved.

                        This paper talked about users' participation in information security risk management (ISRM) and how it may contribute to efficient risk management in organizations.
                        This paper made use of a multi-method approach that involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine user participation in SRM. From the study, qualitative methods were used to provide an understanding of the activities, behaviors, and assignments that define user participation which led to the development of a theoretical model. This theoretical model developed was then tested using the quantitative method which led to a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the study (Spears & Barki, 2010).
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         Users are generally presented as the weakest link in security in typical information security literature, but this study highlighted the benefits of involving users in the risk management process. Users participating in SRM led to an increased organization awareness of information security risks due to users being assigned SRM activities including working on specific controls giving them more visibility to security risks and controls for mitigating these risks.
                          User participation in SRM contributed to improvements in control design due to the valuable feedback that was received from them to confirm if the controls were feasible to be used on a day-to-day basis. (Spears & Barki, 2010)
                                <br> 
                                <br>
                          By having users participate in SRM, users that are considered the weakest link in information security became the greatest asset in the effort to make reduce risk related to information security and make security better aligned with business objectives Deli et al. (2017).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                          Users being able to be assigned responsibilities and activities is key to analysis in SRM. Without user access, the qualitative method, which is meant to be exploratory, relatively easy, cheap, and not based on any previous theories, concepts will be used in a limited way. The quantitative method will have to be explored which typically deals with the complete investigation meaning that analysis will generally be more expensive, will demand more detailed tools (Rot, 2008), or else it will be performed using generic information and guesses.

                        <h4>
                        Thank you all for a great turnout! It was lovely catching up with everybody and having a full team on a call.
                            <br> <br>
                        We have discussed the preparation for the seminar and the following was agreed:
                        By the end of Monday (4th of July), everyone will post an individual list of 5 overall risk causes in the group file.
                        Tuesday morning Ags will compile a list of 5 most often mentioned.
                        By the end of Wed (6th of July) everyone will submit their individual mitigations (1 per each cause in the team list).
                        During Thursday (before the seminar) Hamad to convert the list of 5 team causes and individual mitigations into a .ppt and share the file in the module group Google folder.
                        Sherelle to present the .ppt on the seminar.
                        Regarding the unit 6 assignment we have agreed to:
                        Kevin will work on research on NIST and justifying our choice.
                        Ags will work on the overall risk analysis (bullet point 2) using the NIST framework and available academic research, where possible.
                        Sherelle, Abidemi and Hamad will work on the Disaster recovery research that would support our RPO/RTO of 15 minutes and 4 hours respectively (please also review the working hours in the unit 3 description, since that will also impact the DR).
                        We will reconvene again next Sunday at 3pm GTM (4pm BST) and discuss what has been done and agree on the next steps.
                        Sherelle has volunteered to share the document and take notes on the next week's call.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Ensure that the project is managed by an experienced Project Manager.</li>
                            <li>Review and document all software requirements, changes and utilize a framework.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the security is built into the code or project, from conception to the delivery to apply (Secure SDLC).</li>
                            <li>See user’s involvement in the software development and implementation, this proved to be of value to successful project delivery.</li>
                            <li>Anticipate possible risk factors in each phase e.g risks outside of the control of the organization such as political, unrest, tax and inflation.</li>

                                This unit is all about Risk, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. Business continuity plan is something that has continually been in my face due to our customers continually insisting on a geographical disaster recovery plan for their servers but I have never been able to align it all together until now. 
                                Learnt all about the vital elements in disaster recovery plans like the Recovery Time Objective(RTO) and the Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

                                Disaster recovery plan could entail restoring data from the backup stored on an offsite location or goes as far as replicating servers in the cloud. Learnt about the different DR strategies namely the cold sites, warm sites and hot sites which further put the geographical disaster recovery in an entirely new perspective for me.
