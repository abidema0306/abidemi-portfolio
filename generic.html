													Taking greater cyber security to protect medical devices is more important now than ever. Medical training devices are becoming more advanced and increasingly dependent on technology which makes them vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and attacks. A team of researchers at the University of South Alabama investigated potential breaches of medical devices used in medical training using iStan medical mannequin as its prime target. A team of computing students carried out these tests and were able to successfully hack into the medical mannequin and eventually kill him. The network security solution and the network protocols were identified as the vulnerable components and through this, the team was able to carry out brute force attacks as well as denial of service attacks Glisson et al (2015).
												</article><br>
												<article>
													Firstly, the network security solution was breached using an open-source software known as Reaver to instigate a brute force attack against the Wi-Fi Protected Setup register PIN numbers. Two steps were used for the brute force attack using the open-source software Reaver which is included with Backtrack 5 from a live CD which took slightly over seven hours while the same brute force attack was tried on the mannequin using the virtual machine which cracked the passphrase in two hours thirty-eight minutes and forty-eight seconds Glisson et al (2015). Mitigation steps could be taken to forestall this attack by either updating the firmware of the access point with firmware that addresses this vulnerability or disabling the WPS which is what the reaver tool used to breach the network security solution (‘Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) Vulnerable to Brute-Force Attack’, 2012).
												</article><br>
												<article>
													Secondly, the network protocols used by iStan consist of TCP and 802.11 wireless transmissions between the controlling laptop and the iStan's internal access point. The network protocol was compromised using HPING3, a testing tool available in windows and Linux to instigate a DoS attack. The DoS attack overwhelmed the network between the mannequin and the controlling computer, and the interface displayed a connection error message during the DOS attack which made the program unable to send any setting changes to the iStan medical mannequin Glisson et al (2015). These DOS attacks can be mitigated by using any firewalls and intrusion detection systems that act as traffic scanning barriers between networks.

														Dear Abidemi, <br>Thank you for you initial post I really enjoyed it. As you also mentioned, the healthcare industry is more vulnerable now than ever, as it depends more and more on technology. Cyberattacks of any kind, such as brute-force and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks as mentioned in the Glisson et. al., (2015) paper, are becoming more complex and prevalent (ENISA, 2020). The healthcare industry itself has been victimised by a variety of cyberattacks over the past years. The attacks often lead to financial loss, breached privacy and, in my opinion most importantly, loss or alteration of patients' data, which automatically puts the patients at risk (CIS, 2017). Founder and CEO of Projetech, Inc., Steve Richmond (2021), suggested that the healthcare industry should consider integrating strong cybersecurity methods and systems, in order to protect patients and their data, their finances and the industry in general. Richmond (2021), also mentioned considering vulnerabilities that are regularly As you also mentioned, the healthcare industry is more vulnerable now than ever, as it depends more and more on technology.

														<br>Do you think there is a specific reason that the healthcare industry lacks a strong cybersecurity system?

														<strong>	Peer Response - Sherelle Garwood </strong><br>
														</h3>
														Hi Abidemi, <br>
														I really enjoyed your post detailing the security threats outlined within the ‘Compromising a medical mannequin’ article. As you mentioned in your post, a brute force attack against the Wi-Fi Protected Setup register PIN numbers using Reaver. Updating the firmware so that it protects against these vulnerabilities seems like the most useful mitigation technique, however, healthcare facilities seem to be reluctant to do this. Do you think this is possible due to the cost of updated firmware? <br>
														Your post also discussed the use of HPING3 to compromise the network, causing a denial of service attack. Firewall and intrusion detection systems are a strong form of prevention against denial of service attacks. However, the systems being used in the medical facility are legacy systems with mass amounts of vulnerabilities. Do you think an overhaul of the network devices would be more useful trying to implement protective measures on a flawed system? <br>

															Hi Abidemi, <br>
															By disabling WPS, the mannequin can't easily connect to the network, making it more vulnerable.  The WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) is a wireless network security standard that makes connections between a router and wireless devices (mannequins) faster and easier. Wireless Protected Setup is a key exchange mechanism rather than a security mechanism. It facilitates connections between devices and access points and is one of the vulnerable points of a network. <br>
															WPS works with WPA/WPA2/PSK and allows devices to establish connections to WLANs. Utilizing the  following methods <br>
															PIN: Entering a PIN on the device. <br>
															PUSH-BUTTON: A physical or virtual push-button should be pressed on both the access point and the client device during the connection phase. <br>
															NFC: To use Near Field Communication, the client must bring their device close to the access point. <br>
															USB drive:  Necessary connection information exchange between an access point and a device is done using a USB drive. <br>
															The short length of WPS PINs and the fact that both PIN parts are validated separately means that an online brute force attack on the PIN can be made within several hours, allowing an attacker to access a WLAN (mannequin device) <br>
															Wireless LAN clients can authenticate their users and ensure user confidentiality through WPA or WPA2. WPA is vulnerable to the offline dictionary attack since the information required to create and verify a session key is broadcasted (Noureddine Boudriga, 2019, p.270) Using WPA2/enterprise security and mutual client and server authentication provides the most secure and protected wireless network compared to the WPA and WEP.<br>

													We were asked to read a research paper titled Compromising a medical Mannequin.  This paper talked about the evaluation and exploiting of vulnerabilities in the medical mannequin which was used in a medical simulation environment. This unit introduced me to the concept of hacking using the reaver software installed on backtrack. Learnt later in the module that backtrack was renamed to Kali Linux. This demonstrated a lack of security for this mannequin because the experiment was conducted by a team of students that had taken cybersecurity courses for only a semester. An initial post was written on this topic using the following discussion questions:
													<ul>
														<li>What are the major threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the paper?														</li>

													Learning Outcomes <br>
													Gathering and synthesizing information from various sources to aid identification and analysis of security risks and vulnerabilities. <br>
													<p>
														The ‘Compromising a Medical Mannequin’ research paper by Glisson et al’s (2015), explored the impact of security breaches on medical mannequin’s within medical training facilities. Medical training devices have become increasingly reliant on technology, leading to a growing need to access and mitigate possible security vulnerabilities.
														The main risks discussed in the Compromising a Medical Mannequin paper (Glisson et al, 2015) are:
													</p> 
												<br>	The main risks discussed in the Compromising a Medical Mannequin paper (Glisson et al, 2015) are: 
-          Brute force attacks against 802.11 wireless transmissions, specifically the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature. <br>
-          DOS attacks on the TPS network protocol used by the mannequin to communicate with the machine controlling it.
													<article>
														When assessing these risks, it is useful to assign each with the risk rating which helps when deciding on the risk response. For this purpose the DREAD risk calculation method (Meier, 2003) can be used. DREAD scores each risk from 0 (no risk) to 3 (high risk) in the following 5 categories: <br>
-          Damage potential – the amount of damage the exploited risk could provide. <br>
-          Reproducibility – the easiness of attack reproduction. <br>
-          Exploitability – how easy to launch the attack?<br>
-          Affected users – the quantity/percentage/bracket of affected users. <br>
-          Discoverability – how easy is it to find the vulnerability? <br>

													</article>
													<p>Using the above DREAD definition, and the scale 0 to 3, the two risks identified above were scored as follows:</p>
																						
												<table>
													
													<tr>
														<th>DREAD category</th>
														<th>Brute force attack</th>
														<th>DOS attack</th>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Damage potential</td>
														<td>3(attacker could gain access to the point of login details, thus getting access to the whole network)</td>
														<td>1(the mannequin would be taken offline impacting only the small group of people)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Reproducibility</td>
														<td>3(the attack can be reproduced at anytime)</td>
														<td>(the attack can be reproduced at anytime)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Exploitability</td>
														<td>3(the attack can be carried by anyone with basic computer understanding)</td>
														<td>3(the attack can be carried out by anyone with basic computer understanding)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Affected users</td>
														<td>3(after gaining access point security details, the follow up attack could impact the whole network)</td>
														<td>1(DOS would impact users of the particular mannequin only)</td>
													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Discoverability</td>
														<td>3(WPS vulnerability has been known for a long time, the step by step guides are available)</td>
														<td>3(The TPS network protocol vulnerabilities are well known)</td>
													</tr>										
											</table>
											<p>The resulting risk total for a brute force attack is 15 (high risk) and 11 (Medium risk). Thus, the brute force attack on a medical mannequin would have a larger impact on the medical training facility than the DOS attack. Please note, that the ‘Affected users’ DREAD category was considered to also include other users within the medical training facility network and not only those directly working with the training mannequin.

												<p> Formative Activities: Summary Post for Collaborative learning Discussion 1 which was centered on the paper <strong>Compromising a Medical Mannequin</strong> </p>
												
												<p>Summary post <br>Healthcare devices represent one of the fastest-growing sectors of the IoT market with an estimated value of $176 billion by 2026 (Fortune Business Insights, 2020). However, despite the numerous benefits IoT devices offer in the healthcare sector, they have also introduced risks to organizations. A team of students hacked into the iStan Mannequin by breaching the security solution using an open-source brute force attack and attacking the network protocol through a denial-of-service attack within a few hours Glisson et al. (2015). </p>
												<p>The wireless access point was using the WPS and WPA PSK which was easily cracked by reaver. To mitigate this risk, the easiest option was to disable WPS manually or implement a lock-down period to avoid brute force attacks (Swan, N.D).  The implementation of WPA2-based encryption and authentication can also be used. Necat (2022)  raised the concern about the IoT devices being limited in resources like memory which might make them sometimes unable to use robust encryption, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) could be used for these IoT devices.</p>
												<p>The network protocol was breached by a DOS attack against the iStan internal access point using the HPING3 tool. Becan (2022) suggested the use of a strong firewall as the first line of defense against DoS attacks. The wireless intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can also be used to constantly scan the network traffic for suspicious events. Other options include the use of VLANs as suggested by Ashmore (2022).
													</p>
												<p>With the increasing number of healthcare-industry security breaches, the issue of security concerning IoT devices will come into the limelight (Mathews, 2016).  2022 State of Healthcare IoT Device Security report from Cynerio states that "More than half of connected medical and IoT devices in hospitals have a known critical vulnerability" (Cynerio, 2022). There is therefore an urgent need to address these security challenges to make the most of IoT for healthcare.

												I was able to learn about the ISO/OSI 7-layer model and evaluated a number of network tools including the ping, traceroute, nslookup and dig. We were assigned a website and asked to use these basic tools to perform a scanning exercise. One of my team mates(Kevin) suggested the use of Kali Linux to run these scans. I downloaded Oracle VirtualBox and installed Kali Linux as a virtual machine on the virtualBox. I then performed the checks  using dig, whois, nslookup e.t.c. As a team we then synchronized the results together.
I also did a summary post of the collaborative discussion 1 which collaborated all the peer responses and added a suitable conclusion.

												During the Unit 3 we have been asked to perform quick individual scans on the website assigned to our team (Group 1): <a href="https://loadedwithstuff.co.uk/">https://loadedwithstuff.co.uk/</a> <br>
										</article>
										<article>	
												Our team used a combination of traceroute, tracert, and tracepath to record the number of hops to our destination. The number varied between 10 and 15. The hop with the highest latency, presented itself between the middle and the end of the traceroute, i.e. between hops 7 and 11 respectively. No lost packets were observed. <br>
											</article>
												The differences in the hop numbers can be explained by our geographical locations (Fei et al, 1998) and our internet providers; our team members have conducted these scans from the UK, Canada, Qatar and Nigeria. The latency differences will be due to the differences between our bandwidth. <br>
											<article>	Next we were asked to find the mail and name servers for the domain. We used a combination of nslookup and web-based tools to identify the name servers below. This indicated to us that the site is being hosted by A2 Hosting
												<ul>
													<li>ns1.a2hosting.com
													</li>
													<li>ns2.a2hosting.com</li>
													<li>ns3.a2hosting.com</li>
													<li>ns4.a2hosting.com
													</li>
													The MX record for the assigned site was confirmed by everyone to be <a href="mail.loadedwithstuff.co.uk.">mail.loadedwithstuff.co.uk.</a>
												</ul>
												
											</article>
											<article>
												Next we were asked to provide the registered contact for the domain. Again we used a combination of the whois command and various web-based resources. We were able to confirm that the registrar for the site is:
												<ul>
													<li>eNom LLC [Tag = ENOM]</li>
													<li><a href=" http://www.enom.com">URL: http://www.enom.com</a></li>
												</ul>
											</article>
											<article>
												While contact information for domains used to be public information, this was changed as a result of the introduction of the GDPR when the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) agreed to start treating this data as personal information that needs to be kept private (Goyal, 2018).

											</article>
											<article>
												The final part of the scan was to identify the physical location of the server hosting the site. Using a variety of web-based IP address geolocation services, we initially suspected that the server was hosted in the USA. However, IP address geolocation is not always accurate, especially when considering addresses assigned to Internet companies, which are free to assign their addresses without regard to geography (IPLocation, 2016). With this in mind, we looked more closely at the network hops identified in our trace routes. These routes all seemed to point to Amsterdam as the correct location. One of our group resides in North America, which made their route particularly interesting; if the site was in the USA then their route should be quite short. Instead, the route showed a trans-Atlantic hop from Montreal to Liverpool which would not have been necessary if the site was in the USA (Pepelnjak, 2019). Based on all of the evidence available, we concluded that the hosting server is most likely located in Amsterdam.

											We were asked to read the some articles on Kali Linux and answer a few sets of questions for each article. Leroux (2020) and Bhatt (2018) talked about use of Kali Linux, what exactly it is used for and  what you must know before using it. 
											<ol> The following three questions were then asked.
												<li>What does the article teach you about carrying vulnerability scans using Kali? <br>
													The two articles clearly articulated that it is an open source linux distribution specially designed to help penetration testing by security professionals and in plain words it is not designed for general purposes. The article clearly highlighted the need to install kali Linux on a Virtual machine and two well known software-assisted virtualization programs for windows were mentioned namely VMware and Oracle’s Virtual-Box. This guarantees that whatever you do inside Kali Linux will not impact your host system. It also teaches me that Kali linux is already pre packed with most of the security tools for vulnerability scanning which I might have to install on a regular linux distribution manually. 
													</li>
												<li>
													What issues might you encounter? <br>
													For me Kali Linux installation and use  was basically easy because of my background with unix and Linux but some of the team mates had issues due to their lack of knowledge of the OS. The only issue i had was reading and understanding the output of the tools when performing vulnerability tests on the assigned website. 

												</li>
												<li>
													How would you overcome them <br>

								I will say the web helped well with understanding what each of these outputs mean and how I was able to relate them to vulnerabilities for the application. As I keep using the tools more and more, I expect it will get easier to understand these outputs.
								<br> We were also asked to read a paper by Bhingardeve & Franklin (2018) which is a comparison study of open source penetration testing tools

												</li>
											</ol>
											<ol> The following two questions were then asked.

												<li>How do their results compare with your initial evaluation <br>

													In my initial evaluation of SQLmap, nmap and Metasploit tools, Metasploit rated higher than SQLmap and nmap compared to the authors’ comparison where nmap was rated higher. I agree that nmap is a powerful tool but I rated it a little lower due to the use of CLI which involves commands. Reading further on this I agree that nmap is a powerful/flexible tool which is quite useful for pentesting or for system administrators who just want to put an eye on their network. I rated SQLmap low also because i feel that it is not documented properly and it makes it difficult to understand how to use it properly.
													</li>
													This was discussed with the team and it ended up getting the same scores.
												<li>
													
										What do you think of their criteria?

												</li>
											</ol>
											<ol>Based on our evaluations, we were asked to consider the recommendations below:
												<li>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs Nessus <br>

													Kali Linux is a free open source tool with a collection of  600 + penetration tools while Nessus is a paid tool which also comes with a limited free edition. With Kali linux tools, the output of the vulnerability testing needs to be mapped manually into a report template but nessus comes with a scan report which can easily be mapped to other formats like excel,csv.
													</li>
												<li>
													Has this changed your original evaluation score <br>

										I evaluated Nessus very low due to the licensing part which is an annual payment compared to Kali Linux which is completely free which means that more people use it and have more experience and lots of materials out there to learn from. The only thing i will probably like to change is the ease of use and flexibility being the fact it is a GUI tool and the ability of getting a scan report after the vulnerability testing.

											This unit is about risks and standards. I was able to learn about the use of risk registers in information security management. Risk register is not a new concept to me from the area of project management but the concept of threat workshops to identify possible risks and vulnerabilities with also the fact that business owners of resources and applications can lose their systems. The steps of risk assessment from the identification/gathering to the analysis to the final part of risk management which is the mitigation phase which for me could be described as the formative steps of a successful cybersecurity strategy.
								<br> I also learnt about business continuity (BCP) and disaster recovery plans. Business continuity plan  is something that has continually been in my face due to our customers continually insisting on a geographical disaster recovery plan for their servers but I have never been able to align it together until now. I have been able to align and see that disaster recovery is a subset of a good Business Continuity plan which allows a business to minimize the effects of outages and disruptions on business operations. My conclusion is that with a good DR plan, a subset of the business operations can at least be available after any form of disruption. I also learnt about the Payment card Industry - data security standard (PCI-DSS).

										<h4>
											The case study used refers to the compromise of the adobe network.  The compromise of adobe network was announced by adobe on October 3rd, 2013 as a data breach (DesJardins, 2014). The hackers gained access to sensitive personal information like customers' email addresses, payment data, customer names, password hints, and physical addresses. This affected about 150million accounts which comprised active and inactive users (DesJardins, 2014).  The active accounts were about 38million with about 3 million customers’ credit and debit card information exposed. This also included the theft of some Adobe products like adobe reader and source code. An old database server which was due to be decommissioned was the entry point for the attackers (Duckett, 2015). <br>
											Although the adobe data breach occurred before GDPR came into effect May 25, 2018 but nevertheless GDPR Art 33 and Art 34 would have addressed this data breach. Art 33 specifically states that the controller should report to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of being aware of it. Art 34 also states that the data subject(customers)must be notified without undue delay anytime personal data breach occurs (Intersoft Consulting, N.D).  Adobe was aware of the breach from about September 17th, 2013 but there was no official announcement until October 3rd 2013, which is more than two weeks after being aware of the incident which would have put them at a high risk of penalties or fines (DesJardins, 2014). <br>
											The hackers were able to exploit vulnerabilities on the public facing server like the fact that although the customers passwords were encrypted but the password hints were not and a lot of the passwords were easy to guess through this unencrypted password hints. Complex passwords were not enforced so a lot of customers used simple passwords like 123456, password, adobe123 etc. (DesJardins, 2014). <br>
											As an Information Security manager, I would have implemented the below as a means of mitigating against this data breach <br>
											<ol>
												<li>Passwords hints should always be encrypted if needed at all. Complex passwords should also be enforced so that passwords will be difficult to guess.</li>
												<li>Multi Factor authentication should be enforced for all customers and employees.</li>
												<li>The server in question might not have the latest SW updates since it was due to be decommissioned. All prospective decommissioned servers should be taken off the network and internet to prevent hackers from accessing the network though these old unused servers.</li>

												<strong>Peer Response 1</strong> <br>
												“Initial Post by Elizabeth Cook - Disclosure of sensitive data by a hospital to a third party” <br>
												Thanks for your interesting views on this.  The accidental disclosure of this data will unfortunately still be classified as a personal data breach. The GDPR defines a personal data breach as a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed (Intersoft Consulting, N.D). <br>
												I will agree that it is hard to imagine modern organizations still handwriting envelopes which was one of the things that led to this accidental disclosure of data which means that it is high time that organizations move towards the secured transmission of data especially health information which falls into the category of “sensitive personal data” within the meaning of the Data Protection Acts [‘The Acts’]. Unauthorized disclosure of personal health information could negatively impact on an individual patient’s personal and professional life(Data Protection Commissioner's office, 2018).
												The transition to paperless medical records has started with the NHS expected to become fully paperless by 2020, this was upwardly reviewed by the government to 2023 who declared that the 2020 was an unrealistic target(Parkin & Loft, 2020). This could be a good thing which will be able to mitigate against issues like this but nevertheless it is a huge transition because healthcare security is one of the most pressing issues in the healthcare sector and IT experts must deal with data security issues and concerns and also the trouble that healthcare data breaches might cause.

												“Initial Post by Isioma Vina Okafor-Tolofari - Failure to respond to an access request”
												<br>Thanks for your interesting writeup about the failure to respond to an access request.
												<br> As you said the data subject made a  subject access request to the data controller for a 4 hours data but the request was not fully responded to so the complainant only got an 11 seconds clip. This subject access request was supported under the Art 15 GDPR which states that the data subject can obtain access to the personal data about himself/herself.((General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), N.D)). Due to the way the educational institute processed this request, this earned the data subject the right to complain to the Data Protection Commission (DPC) and which the data subject did. The DPC is Ireland’s independent authority with responsibility for upholding the right of people in the EU to have their personal data protected. It monitors compliance with GDPR and other data protection legislation and deals with complaints in relation to data protection breaches.(Citizens Information, N.D). The complainant may complain to the DPC if:
												<ol>
													<li>The complaint was refused access to the cctv images.</li>
													<li>If the complainant was not satisfied with the response to the request.</li>

										<h4>
											The case study refers to the compromise of Adobe Network which was a data security breach involves the illegal access of its users’ personally identifiable information (PII) and source code of some Adobe products. This data security breach compromised the personal data of adobe customers and the hackers also took off with source code of some Adobe software properties namely Adobe Acrobat and Reader and Photoshop (Adobe Support, 2013). <br>
											Cook (2022) raised an interesting point that states that "Whilst GDPR states that an organization must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach (GDPR, 2018) the point of when the breach is confirmed can sometimes be up for debate and therefore from what point does the 72 hours start". Art.33 GDPR states that "Where it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases to the supervisory authority without undue delay (Intersoft Consulting, N.D).  On 3rd of October, Adobe reported that between 30 August 2013 and 17 September 2013, an authorized third party illegally accessed certain customer order information but they became aware on the 17th of September when there was an attempt to decrypt card numbers which eventually led to the discovery that the attackers had accessed a public facing web server and compromised it. (2). Under GDPR, this should have been notified to the supervisory in phases. <br>
											Tolofari (2022) also states the organization is obligated to ensure the security of the personal data in accordance with the principle of integrity and confidentiality despite it happening before GDPR came in effect. On 13 December, the Australian privacy commissioner opened its own motion investigation into Adobe Systems Software Ireland and they concluded that Adobe breached the Privacy Act 1988 by failing to protect the personal information that it stored from misuse, unauthorized access or loss (Australian Government, Office of the Australian Information Commissioner,2015). <br>
											Adobe was eventually fined $1million for its massive 2013 data breach that exposed the information of about 38million users which was used to settle a lawsuit in the United States but as (Keane, 2016) stated such a breach under the new General Data Protection (GDPR) which went into effect in 2018 would have faced a bigger fine for European customers. <br>
											Data breaches are occurring more frequently so it is important that companies take the protection of customers data seriously.

													Hello everyone, <br>
													Thank you for participating in what looks to have been our last team meeting. It was a pleasure to work with you all.
													During our call we have finalised our Executive summary, submitted it to Turninit and then made the actual submission. <br>
													We have also agreed that Kevin would cover the Security point in our debate and Sherelle emailed us with her point. I will be covering the topic on caching.

											<li>Debate Opening Argument 5: Seamless Consumer Mobility <br>
												Mobile devices  in the TCP/IP world require an ip address to communicate with other devices which means that for mobile devices, when the physical location is changed, it needs to acquire a new IP address for communication to be feasible. (Saxena et al, 2016)
												<article>
													The current internet architecture(TCP/IP) has a long standing challenge with host mobility when wireless networks integrate the internet into their architectures. The current internet architecture has a huge proportion of traffic being attributed to mobile devices using mobile data especially for video streaming services. (Tyson et al, 2012)
												</article>
												<article>
													Future internet architectures like content-centric architectures (NDN, CCN) propose a key paradigm shift for consumer mobility which involves replacing the current Internet architecture’s existing host-centric paradigm with an information(content)-centric networking paradigm which supports data access by contents rather than IP addresses. (Tyson et al, 2012)
												</article>
												<article>
													This added benefit  enables mobile users to have better data access since they do not have to keep acquiring IP addresses every time their location changes which will allow them continue their communication during unavailability of published content or topological change.

													Achievement:  We used different scanning tools to confirm the presence of the exposures namely OSWAP ZAP, Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Wappalyzer, Nmap, Nessus, SQL Injection scanners.the Dread tool to achieve the rating. We used the DREAD tool to analyze the risk rating for each vulnerability and categorized them in the OWASP top 10 Category for 2021.
													We divided the vulnerabilities into the different OWASP top 10 categories and splitted among ourselves.
													I applied Wappalyzer to check the vulnerable and outdated components according to OWASP category A06:2021. I also used manual checks to check for A07:2021 which detected the below.

											Comparing the executive summary and the proposal

											We implemented everything from our proposal into the executive summary. We replaced the  STRIDE methodology and used OWASP top 10 to categorize the vulnerabilities.
